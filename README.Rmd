ShinyApp to know what to expect when you shoot at things in W40K

## What's it for ?	
Have you ever wonder why your space marines can't dent the baneblade opposite them ? Well wonder no more ! With this Shiny app you'll be able to see your average damage output with any kind of weapon strength, opposing toughness and saves with any hit or wound modifier know to mankind (and xenos kind) ! Easy to use and understand. Now you'll be a pro at killing what you are hitting at ! No more knife to a gun fight !

## Overview

In this app, you can easily simulate the damge output of any weapons against any targets. Just use the sliders to adjust the parameters and it will produce data to help guide your decisions.
It uses a binomial distribution with a probability computed with the parameters given. You'll be served graphs (probability density of the binomial for those of you stats enclined) giving you the probability to wound a certain amount of damages with some usefull extra stats displayed.

## Installation

You can install the development version of DamageSimulatorW40K like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

# TODO
Put all function in an other file
Maybe put stat calculator as its own shiny module. Like weapon profile as its own  UI for example./ I dont knoqw
Do the graph now for the kill count
Get summary stats displayed somewhere to have an easy to compare value tlo start implementing global testing on the final output
Add testing for all small functions to start working on adding hit modifier
