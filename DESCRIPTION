Description: In this app, you can easily compute the damage output of any
    weapons against any targets.  Just use the sliders to adjust the
    parameters and it will produce data to help guide your decisions.  It
    uses a binomial distribution with a probability computed with the
    parameters given.  You'll be served graphs (probability density of the
    binomial for those of you stats enclined) giving you the probability
    to wound a certain amount of damages with some usefull extra stats
    displayed.
